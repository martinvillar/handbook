This text serves two simultaneous purposes that mutually feedback to each other: it is a user manual as it explains how some processes work inside Manas and it's also an instruction manual since it describes certain goals we want to achieve. In alignment with our principles, the text is in a repository where you can comment on it and send your change proposals. This text will always be a beta version. If you agree with parts of the manual, but you don't think they are correctly implemented in reality, let your voice be heard clear and loud and help us correct what you can. If you disagree with parts of the manual, please suggest the change you'd like to see and help us implement it.
